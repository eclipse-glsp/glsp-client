## [v1.0.0 - 30/06/2022](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

### Changes

-   [diagram] Fixed a bug where the edge creation tool would select the wrong child when used inside of a nested node [#158](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client/pull/158/)
-   [example] Improved and modernized styling of the GLSP workflow example [#160](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client/pull/160)
-   [contextMenu] Ensured that closing the context menu correctly restores the diagram focus. [#469](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client/pull/161)
-   [build] Updated Typescript to version 4.5.5 and enforced `noImplicitOverride` [#167](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client/pull/167)
-   [diagram] Added support for snapping edges (routing points) similar to how its done for moving/resizing elements. [#170](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client/pull/170)
-   [layout] Implemented a custom layouter for HBox that supports nested compartments. [#174](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client/pull/174)
-   [diagram] Disable tool execution on focus loss and reactive the default tools. [#175](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client/pull/175)
-   [routing] Routing handles are now properly snapped if an `ISnapper` implementation is bound. [#177](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client/pull/177)
-   [routing] Fixed a bug that caused short animation flickering whenever a routing point was moved. [#182](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client/pull/182)
-   [context] Properly integrated the browser context menu listeners -> Context menus now also work on Mac OS [#183](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client/pull/183)

### Breaking Changes

-   [protocol] Updated to sprotty >=0.11.0. With the new sprotty version the action declaration approach has been reworked from ES6 classes to plain interfaces + namespaces. To keep action declaration and creation consistent all action definitions of the protocol and client package have been updated as well. The old class based definitions are no longer available. This mainly affects construction calls
    which have to be changed from `new SomeAction()` to using the create function of the corresponding namespace `SomeAction.create()`. In addition, typeguard functions have been included in the action namespaces as well and can now be used with `SomeAction.is()` instead of using a dedicated `isSomeAction()` function.
    <br>[#472](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client/pull/171) - Contributed on behalf of STMicroelectronics
-   [DI] Unified the sprotty `TYPE` and `GLSP_TYPE` service identifier constants. They are reexported from the client main index as `TYPE`. The old `GLSP_TYPE` constant definition has been
    deprecated will potentially be removed in the future. [#472](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client/pull/171)
-   [protocol] Rename `ModelSourceChangedAction` to `SourceModelChangedAction` including handlers etc [#655](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client/pull/184)
-   [diagram] Cleanup/refactor various commands and action handlers. [#176](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client/pull/176)
    -   Rename `layoutCommandsModule` to `layoutModule`
    -   Change handling of `ResizeElement` and `AlignElement` actions to pure action handlers instead of commands.
    -   Change handling of `NavigateToMarkersAction` to a pure action handler instead of commands
    -   Refactor handler for `SetMarkersAction` to a standalone action handler instead of an command

## [v0.9.0- 09/12/2021](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client/releases/tag/v0.9.0)

-   [protocol] Added `fileUri` property to `SaveModelAction`. This can be used to implement save-as functionality [#109](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client/pull/109)
-   [protocol] Implemented missing typeguard functions for all protocol operations [#110](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client/pull/110)

    Introduced reusable view for rounded corner nodes and and improved edge view that supports custom padding for easer mouse handling. Adapted the workflow example to make use of these new views [#113](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client/pull/113)
-   [example] Cleaned up and reworked the workflow example. Additional css classes are now applied directly to the `SModelElement` instead of using custom views. Removed now obsolete classes `TaskNodeView` and `WeightedEdgeView` [#116](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client/pull/116)

## [v0.8.0 - 20/10/2020](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client/releases/tag/0.8.0)

This is the first release of Eclipse GLSP since it is hosted at the Eclipse Foundation.
The 0.8.0 release includes new protocol message types and respective framework support for several new features, such as copy-paste, diagram navigation, etc. It also contains several clean-ups of the protocol and refactorings to simplify and streamline the API.
